				<h2>Chapter 14<em>Enhancements and Effects with CSS</em></h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Done!</li>
					<li>Graceful degradation is a web development technique, where the performance is optimized for the newest browsers, but comprimised for older ones.</li>
					<li>Progressive enhancement works the other way around. It starts by making sure that all the important features are available for all browsers in use, and than adds a little extra for the modern ones.</li>
					<li>Graceful degradation is faster to use and works great in modern browsers, however, it lacks some of its functionalities when it comes to older machines.</li>
					<li>Polyfills are JavaScript plug-ins, that make some of the new html5 and css3 features available for older browsers that don't support these functionalities. For example Web Storage API, Modernizer...</li>
					<li>Vendor prefixes are typicaly used while implementing modern css3 tags, that haven't been established as a standard yet. Therefore, they need to be specified for different browsers. As an example we can mention -webkit- or -moz-o-.</li>
					<li>Modernizer helps us improve the user's experience in older browsers by runing a series of test while the webpage loads.</li>
					<li>CSS3 playgound:
						<div class="falcon">Millenium Falcon</div>
