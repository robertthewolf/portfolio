	<section>
		<p><strong>RAA began with 3 students and a shared passion to combat climage change</strong></p>
		<p>We've introduced a competitively priced and community friendly package-free store to encourage sustainable and eco-friendly shopping.</p>
		<p>As biology students confronted with the challenges of climate change, we experienced the environmental effects of modern throw-away society. Seeing no quick-fix to waste management, we realised change needs to happen from the inside out.</p>
		<p>As part of the solution, Raa empowers Danes with a simple approach towards sustainable and eco-friendly shopping habits.</p>

			<h2>What or who initiated your love for the environment and its sustainability? </h2>
			<p>Ever since the first announcements of the global warming i’ve been doing small things as turning off the lights because i REALLY love nature and can’t bear the thought of destroying it. So last year when, I started studying Biology and participated in a beach clean up at our west coast it got clear to me how serious the problem is, and ever since then, i’ve done my best to change habits, and live more sustainable. </p>
			<h2>What is your favourite bulk good we can find in your store?</h2>
			<p>I think my favourite bulk must be the Hampefrø. I love that they are so healthy, local and very easy to produce. In my opinion they must be the most sustainable alternative to all the superfoods like chiaseads we import. </p>

			<h2>What or who initiated your love for the environment and its sustainability? </h2>
			<p>I have always had a love for the nature and animals - i “adopted” a orangutang when i had enough pocketmoney for it.  All the terrifering reports that are coming almost everyday now scares me, and when this opportunity came, i knew that i had to do it! I really hope that with all the great initiatives that we can do a difference for the our earth and the future. </p>
			<h2>What is your favourite bulk good we can find in your store?</h2>
			<p>In our store i mostly enjoy our coffee from Coffee Mountain. They do so much for the coffee farmers in Africa - the owner goes down there himself and start different projects to help the local community. When it is done that way, you know what the moneys goes to - and that is rare.</p>

			<h2>What or who initiated your love for the environment and its sustainability? </h2>
			<p>
My relationship to nature has always been good. But especially when I was volunteering on a nature conservation project in Fiji, where I worked with the sea, I became particularly aware of the consequences of global warming and our overuse of plastic, which offend ends up in the oceans.</p>
			<h2>What is your favourite bulk good we can find in your store?</h2>
			<p>My favorite product in RAA maybe our bamboo toothbrushes from the Danish brand Biobørsten. Especially in bathrooms we have a lot of plastic, so why not start changing something with a sustainable product, and the toothbrushes is a good and easy place to start. Actually in Denmark we use 600 tons of plastic a year on just toothbrushes - scary!</p>
